      Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated
      for sure.. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of
      grease! Now come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans?
      What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret
      this. There goes another one. Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It
      must have been short-circuited. That's funny, the damage doesn't look as
      bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe? What a piece of junk.
      She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like
      much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special
      modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard
      we'll get out of here. Hello, sir. Which way? All right, men. Load your
      weapons! Stop that ship! Blast 'em! Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my.
      I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel. Run, Luke! Run!
